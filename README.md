# SafetyNet
SafetyNet is an implementation of Bi-LSTM RNN to process live feed from webcam to detect violence. <br>
It is aimed to be implemented with police bodycams to help prevent accidental loss of lives due to misinterpretation of actions by law enforcement officials. <br>
There is also a deployment version of SafetyNet on Huggingface Spaces, which can be used as a simple Threat Detection System over pre-recorded mp4/avi/webm videos. Visit the Space [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jeonananya/threat_detection).
